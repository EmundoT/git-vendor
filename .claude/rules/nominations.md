# Nominations

When you discover something worth surfacing to the project owner but outside your current task scope — refactoring opportunities, cross-project patterns, bugs, tooling gaps — use the `/nominate` skill to append a structured entry to `.claude/nominations.md`.

Do NOT create nominations for trivial issues you can fix inline (typos, dead imports, stale comments). Only nominate items that require owner decision or are outside your authorized scope.
